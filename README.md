# ImageSend
Sends an image between a client and a server

Run the server first and then the client. You may have to edit the code if you are running the client and server on different devices. 

Type in the name of the image that you are trying to transfer between the client and the server.

This works both from the client to the server (done.png) and from the server to the client (done1.png).
